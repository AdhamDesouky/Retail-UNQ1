## Introduction

The retail industry relies heavily on data analysis to drive business decisions and improve performance. This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales and profit data by category and region, with visualizations to help understand the data better. The final output is a comprehensive PDF report summarizing the key insights and recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Sample Superstore dataset. It includes various attributes related to sales, profits, discounts, and more across different categories and regions.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `fpdf`

## Data Exploration

Initial data exploration includes loading the dataset, checking for missing values, inspecting data types, and performing summary statistics. This helps in understanding the structure and contents of the data.

## Data Visualization

Several types of visualizations are created to gain insights into the data:
- **Heatmap**: Visualizes the relationship between Category and Sub-Category.
- **Scatter Plot**: Analyzes the relationship between Sales and Profit.
- **Box Plot**: Compares the distribution of Sales across different Regions.
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the proportion of Sales for each Category.

## PDF Report Generation

A detailed PDF report is generated using the `fpdf` library. The report includes:
- Introduction and overview of the analysis.
- Visualizations with descriptive titles and insights.
- Summary statistics, missing values check, and data types.
- Conclusion and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Conclusion

The EDA performed in this project highlights key areas where the retail business can focus to improve performance and profitability. Specific recommendations are provided to help guide decision-making processes.

## Usage
